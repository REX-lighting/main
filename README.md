# main
This is the main repo that combines everything together. The main controller is [here](https://github.com/REX-lighting/main/blob/main/main_controler.toe). Download touch designer and open this file with it. From here the visuals should be active. The repo is designed to act similar to a DJ controller. There are two decks. Each deck has a foreground and a background. This allows blending between the decks. There are also a series of filters. 

These are controlled with a MIDI controller. For developing with a different controller you will have to remap the buttons (see below).

For new users I would suggest launching the file and moving around the sliders to see what happens.
